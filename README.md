# P03_SalesDatabase
Another code first db I did as a homework.
Problem descriptions: 
Sales Database
Create a database for storing data about sales using the Code First approach. The database should look like this:
 
Constraints
Your namespaces should be:
•	P03_SalesDatabase
•	P03_SalesDatabase.Data
•	P03_SalesDatabase.Data.Models
Your classes should be:
•	SalesContext – your DbContext
•	Product:
	ProductId
	Name (up to 50 characters, unicode)
	Quantity (real number)
	Price
	Sales
•	Customer:
	CustomerId
	Name (up to 100 characters, unicode)
	Email (up to 80 characters, not unicode)
	CreditCardNumber (string)
	Sales
•	Store:
	StoreId
	Name (up to 80 characters, unicode)
	Sales
•	Sale:
	SaleId
	Date
	Product
	Customer
	Store
Bonus Task
Write a seed method that fills the database with sample data (randomly generated).
4.	Products Migration
For table Products add string column Description, up to 250 symbols. Use migrations. The migration should be named: "ProductsAddColumnDescription". Add a default value for the description property: "No description".
5.	Sales Migration
For table Sales make Date column with default value GETDATE() function, called from the database, not the application. Use explicit migration. Do not use DateTime.Now! Name the migration “SalesAddDateDefault”.
After that, open your table data and see if the default value is applied or not.
Keep your namespaces from Task 3 and do both Task 4 and Task 5 before testing your project in Judge. Make sure to upload your migrations too!
